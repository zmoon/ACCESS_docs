Welcome to ACCESS's documentation!
==================================

The Atmospheric Chemistry and Canopy Exchange Simulation System (ACCESS) 
is a 1-dimensional model for exchange of gases between the surface 
and the overlying atmospheric boundary layer air. 

`Rick Saylor <https://www.atdd.noaa.gov/about-us/staff-directory/rick-saylor-profile/>`_ 
has developed ACCESS since the early 2010s. ACCESS v1.0 was published in ACP [#f1]_.
